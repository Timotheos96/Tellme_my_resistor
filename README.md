# Tellme_my_resistor

A Python application that takes as an input an image of the resistor and returns the value of the resistor
The main idea is to use colour segmentation to separate the colour bands on the resistor. Then identify the location of each color so the resistor value can be calculated correctly.

This table is being used as a reference point to calculate the resistor value:
